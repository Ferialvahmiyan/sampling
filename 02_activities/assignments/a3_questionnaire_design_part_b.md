# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

 Strengths of the Survey
- Diverse Questions: The survey covers critical factors like job satisfaction, recognition, managerial support, and career growth, all of which are common influences on employee retention.
- Qualitative and Quantitative Data: Questions like "What changes, if any, would make you more likely to stay?" allow employees to provide open-ended feedback, while rating questions can be quantified for clearer analysis.
- Direct Focus on Pain Points: Questions like ‚ÄúWhat is the primary reason you are considering leaving?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat do you believe is the biggest challenge that entry-level employees face?‚Äù directly address reasons behind turnover.
- 
Potential Limitations and Considerations
- Sampling Bias: If the survey is administered only to those who are currently employed, it may miss insights from recent leavers. Including responses from employees who have already left could give a fuller picture of turnover causes.
- Response Bias: Employees still employed might hesitate to provide fully honest answers for fear of repercussions. Ensuring anonymity in responses is crucial to mitigate this.
- Representation of Entry-Level Positions: Since turnover is most pronounced in entry- and lower-level positions, it‚Äôs important to confirm that this survey reaches enough respondents from those roles. If the survey is broadly distributed, responses from mid- or senior-level employees may dilute the focus on entry-level challenges.

Expectation of Representativeness
If the sample includes responses from a variety of departments and job levels, particularly focusing on entry- and lower-level positions, then it could be representative of your target population. However, to be truly representative, the survey must:

- Target Entry-Level Employees Specifically: Make sure there‚Äôs a way to identify responses from entry-level employees without compromising anonymity, possibly by including an optional question about the respondent‚Äôs job level.
- Include Exit Survey Data: Incorporate feedback from employees who have recently left, as they often provide the most candid feedback on reasons for turnover.
Overall, with careful sampling and an emphasis on confidentiality, this survey can yield valuable, representative insights into turnover drivers and possible solutions to improve employee retention.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

To refine the original survey based on the class content regarding error, survey quality, and ethics, a few adjustments can be made to improve clarity, reduce bias, and ensure that responses are more representative of the target population. Below, I'll outline the changes and the reasoning behind them.

Original Survey (for reference):
- 1- How long have you been employed in your current position?
- 2- What is the primary reason you are considering leaving your position or have already left?
- 3- How would you rate your overall job satisfaction in your current role?
- 4- How often do you receive feedback or recognition for your work?
- 5- How satisfied are you with the opportunities for career growth and advancement at the company?
- 6- Do you feel that your work is adequately supported by your manager or team leads?
- 7- What changes, if any, would make you more likely to stay at the company?
- 8- How likely are you to recommend working at this company to a friend or family member?
- 9- What do you believe is the biggest challenge that entry-level employees face at this company?
- 10- What additional support or resources would help improve your experience at work?

Anonymity and Ethics (New Section):

- Change: Add a disclaimer at the beginning of the survey to reassure respondents about the confidentiality of their answers.
- Reason: To address ethical concerns, especially regarding sensitive feedback about turnover, it‚Äôs essential to assure respondents that their answers will be confidential and anonymous.
- New Section:
"This survey is completely anonymous, and your responses will be kept confidential. Please answer honestly, as your feedback will help improve the work environment."

Demographic Information (New Question):
- Change: Add a question asking respondents to identify their job level (e.g., entry-level, mid-level, senior-level).
- Reason: This helps ensure the survey results are representative of the target population (entry- and lower-level employees), and it allows for segmented analysis of the responses by job level.
- New Question:

"What is your current job level?"

Clarification of the "Primary Reason" Question:

- Change: Reword the "primary reason" question to avoid leading or vague answers.
- Reason: Ensure clarity and eliminate potential biases by making the question more specific and providing context for the term "primary reason."
- Revised Question:

"What is the main reason you are considering leaving your position or have already left?

Follow-up for Non-Respondents (Error Control):

- Change: Add a follow-up question to inquire why respondents didn‚Äôt answer certain questions or skipped them.
- Reason: This will help identify potential sources of error in the survey (e.g., ambiguous questions, technical issues, or reluctance to answer specific questions).
- New Question:

"If you skipped any questions, please let us know why."
[Open-ended response]


3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

a purely observational study would not fully meet the purpose of understanding why employees are leaving and how to improve their satisfaction, for several reasons:
- Understanding Reasons for Turnover:
  
	- Survey: The survey directly asks employees about the reasons they are leaving or considering leaving, which is a crucial part of the analysis. These reasons can be highly personal, and only employees themselves 	can provide clear, specific answers.
	- Observational Study: While an observational study could reveal some patterns, such as employees who seem disengaged or exhibit signs of dissatisfaction (e.g., frequent absences, decreased productivity, or 		interaction with management), it would not provide direct insights into the specific causes behind these behaviors. For example, an observer might notice an employee working less, but without asking the employee, 	you wouldn't know whether it's due to a lack of career growth, poor management, or another factor.
     
- Employee Feedback on Job Satisfaction:
	- Survey: The survey allows employees to reflect on their job satisfaction, rate their experiences, and provide feedback on aspects like career growth opportunities, feedback, and recognition. It directly asks 	for their opinions and feelings.
	- Observational Study: In an observational study, you could observe employees‚Äô body language, interactions, and productivity, but these observations wouldn‚Äôt provide subjective insights into job satisfaction. 	People might behave differently in a workplace setting than they feel internally, making it hard to infer satisfaction levels purely through observation.
   
- Ethical and Practical Concerns:
  
	- Survey: Employees may feel more comfortable sharing honest feedback anonymously in a survey, especially when it comes to sensitive issues like dissatisfaction with their manager or workplace environment.
	- Observational Study: Employees might alter their behavior when they know they are being observed (observer effect), leading to skewed or less authentic data. Furthermore, observing employees without their 		consent could raise ethical concerns about privacy and trust.
   
- Identifying Specific Solutions:
  
	- Survey: The survey asks about specific changes employees would like to see, such as improved feedback, better work-life balance, or clearer career progression paths. These insights are actionable and can guide 	the company in making specific improvements.
	- Observational Study: While an observational study could help identify areas where employees seem to struggle (e.g., long hours, disengagement in meetings), it would not provide the detailed suggestions for 	change that a survey would.
   
- Conclusion:
While an observational study can provide valuable indirect data about employee behavior (such as engagement levels or stress indicators), it would not be sufficient to comprehensively understand the reasons for high turnover or the specific changes needed to improve employee satisfaction. A survey is essential for gathering direct feedback and actionable insights, particularly on sensitive topics like reasons for leaving, job satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement. Therefore, both methods could complement each other, but the survey is necessary for fulfilling the study's purpose.
