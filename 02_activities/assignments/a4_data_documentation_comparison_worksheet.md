	Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)	Canadian Election Study Online Survey, 2019	Trophic niche flexibility in Glossophaga soricina: how nectar seeker sneaks an insect snack
Sample type	two-stage stratified sampling design	The sample type for the Canadian Election Study 2019 Online Survey includes detailed demographic, geographic, and political characteristics of respondents who participated in the study	the sample type includes both direct behavioral observations and biological samples (e.g., feces for DNA analysis) to understand the dietary habits of the bats.
Sample size	Approximately 50,000 telephone numbers were selected, and about 40,000 invitation letters were sent for an electronic questionnaire, targeting a completion rate of around 24,000 questionnairesâ€‹	The sample size for the Canadian Election Study (CES) 2019 Online Survey is approximately 37,822 respondents	does not specify a precise number of individual Glossophaga soricina bats that were observed or sampled. However, the research primarily relies on field observations and DNA barcoding of fecal samples to analyze the bats' diet, and these methods typically involve data collection from a manageable number of individuals to make inferences about broader behaviors or dietary habits.
Target population	included Canadians aged 15 and older who were residing in the ten provinces.	The target population for the Canadian Election Study 2019 Online Survey includes Canadian citizens aged 18 and older who were eligible to vote in the 2019 federal election. The survey aimed to capture a representative sample of this population to study political attitudes and behaviors	is the species Glossophaga soricina, also known as the southern long-tongued bat. Specifically, the study targets the population of Glossophaga soricina bats that inhabit Neotropical regions and engage in nectar-feeding behaviors, but also occasionally consume insects.
Sampling frame	consisted of individuals aged 15 and over residing in the ten Canadian provinces. It excluded full-time residents of institutions (such as hospitals and prisons) to focus on the general household population. The survey used contact lists and telephone directories as part of its sampling frame to reach respondents through telephone interviews, a common approach for ensuring broad demographic representation within the population.	The sampling frame for the Canadian Election Study 2019 Online Survey consists of a panel of respondents recruited to represent the Canadian electorate. The panel likely includes individuals from various demographic and geographic segments, ensuring alignment with the target population of eligible Canadian voters aged 18 and older	"Glossophaga soricina populations

Survey mode(s)	was conducted primarily through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI)	The survey mode(s) for the Canadian Election Study 2019 included an online survey, where respondents participated through a web-based platform. This mode was chosen to gather data efficiently and reach a broad range of participants across Canada	the survey mode(s) are not traditional in the sense of human-centered surveys. Instead, the study utilizes field-based observational and sampling methods to gather data on the feeding behaviors and dietary habits of the Glossophaga soricina bats.
Timeline	was conducted over the course of 2018, with data collection occurring throughout that year.	The timeline for the Canadian Election Study 2019 spans key phases of the federal election, including pre-election, election, and post-election periods. Data collection for the online survey occurred during and around these phases to capture voter attitudes and behaviors over time	Given the nature of the study, the entire timeline for data collection and analysis likely took several months to a year
Response rate	about 60% across household surveys	Response rates in such surveys typically depend on recruitment strategies and panel engagement	In the study the concept of a response rate does not apply in the traditional sense, as it would in a human-based survey.
Weights	The survey used a weighting factor, known as the basic weighting factor (WGHT_PER), to ensure the results accurately reflect the population of non-institutionalized Canadians aged 15 and over. 	For the response rate of the Canadian Election Study 2019 Online Survey, the codebook outlines that the overall response rate was about 9.2% for the first wave, and for the second wave, it was slightly higher. This reflects the challenges typical in online surveys, particularly with panel-based approaches.	he study's data comes from field observations, sample collection, and acoustic recordings, which are analyzed directly without the need for weights.
Data processing	The survey highlights that 79% of Canadians in this age group reported engaging in volunteer activities	Data processing for the Canadian Election Study 2019 involved cleaning and transforming survey data to ensure accuracy. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and adjusting weights to reflect the population structure. The codebook provides more details on the specific steps, such as the use of demographic weighting to align the sample with the Canadian population	"data processing in this study involved:
Qualitative processing of field observation data,
DNA analysis to identify prey species from fecal samples,
Acoustic data processing to analyze bat calls, and
Statistical analysis to interpret the relationships between bat behavior and diet."
Cleaning, imputation, etc.	The General Social Survey (GSS) on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (GVP) made significant changes to its methodology over time, particularly in 2018, when it introduced an internet-based survey option. This change was made in response to evolving technological usage and the need to accommodate Canadians' time constraints. The shift to an electronic questionnaire likely influenced survey results, and comparisons with previous years are not recommended due to the potential impact of this methodological change. Additionally, the GSS reworked questions to better reflect the rise of online technologies and social media, while setting thresholds for volunteer hours and donation amounts in the electronic version to streamline the survey process	The data cleaning and processing for the Canadian Election Study 2019 involved handling missing data, recoding variables, and ensuring consistency across responses. Imputation was used for missing values, and weighting techniques were applied to align the sample with the national demographics	cleaning in this study likely involved ensuring that biological samples were uncontaminated, ensuring that only valid observational data were included, and processing acoustic data to isolate relevant bat calls. Imputation would have been limited since much of the data were directly observed or biologically sampled, though missing or poor-quality samples might have been excluded from analysis.
Sources of error	"The introduction of internet-based surveys in 2018 alongside traditional telephone interviews created a potential bias.
Certain groups, such as younger individuals or those without reliable phone or internet access, may have been underrepresented in the survey. 
Respondents were asked to recall their volunteer activities, which could lead to inaccuracies.
There were notable differences in how various generations engaged with volunteering, and these differences could have led to errors in data interpretation."	The Canadian Election Study 2019 identified several sources of error, including sampling error due to the reliance on a panel-based sample, non-sampling errors from potential biases in respondent selection or participation, and measurement errors arising from question wording or respondent misinterpretation	"Sampling Bias
Observer Bias
Contamination in DNA Barcoding
Incomplete or Poor-Quality Samples
Acoustic Data Interpretation
Environmental Variability
Taxonomic Error in Insect Identification
Sample Size Limitations"
Limitations, known biases	"Methodological Changes
Non-Response and Coverage Bias
Recall Bias
Generational Bias"	The Canadian Election Study 2019 has several limitations and known biases. These include self-selection bias from panel members, nonresponse bias, and potential issues with coverage bias due to the online nature of the survey. Additionally, there may be measurement errors stemming from survey question interpretation and the exclusion of certain populations (e.g., those without internet access). These biases can impact the representativeness of the sample	The limitations and biases in this study reflect the challenges inherent in ecological field research, particularly when it comes to observational data, biological sampling, and the complexities of analyzing animal behavior. While the study offers valuable insights into the dietary flexibility of Glossophaga soricina, these biases and limitations should be considered when interpreting the results.
