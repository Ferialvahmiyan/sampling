# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to gather insights from current employees who occupy entry- and lower-level positions regarding their reasons for leaving the company, job satisfaction, and potential improvements that could enhance retention. This will help inform strategies to address the high turnover rate and improve employee engagement.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: The target population refers to the group of individuals we aim to understand or make conclusions about based on the survey results. In this case, the target population consists of employees in entry- and lower-level positions at the company across various departments, as they are most affected by the turnover issue.

Sampling Frame: The sampling frame is the actual list or database from which the sample is drawn. Here, it would be the companyâ€™s HR database of all current employees in entry- and lower-level roles, categorized by department. This ensures that every employee in these positions has a chance of being selected for the survey.

Sampling Units: Sampling units are the individual elements or entities selected from the sampling frame to be included in the sample. In this survey, the sampling units are the individual employees in entry- and lower-level positions, as each selected employee will provide their unique perspectives and feedback on job satisfaction and turnover.

Observational Units: Observational units refer to the specific entities on which data is collected during the survey process. For this survey, the observational units are also the individual employees from entry- and lower-level positions. These are the employees who will directly provide responses to each survey question, thus providing the data used for analysis.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. How long have you been employed in your current position?
2. What is the primary reason you are considering leaving your position or have already left?
3. How would you rate your overall job satisfaction in your current role?
4. How often do you receive feedback or recognition for your work?
5. How satisfied are you with the opportunities for career growth and advancement at the company?
6. Do you feel that your work is adequately supported by your manager or team leads?
7. What changes, if any, would make you more likely to stay at the company?
8. How likely are you to recommend working at this company to a friend or family member?
9. What do you believe is the biggest challenge that entry-level employees face at this company?
10.What additional support or resources would help improve your experience at work?
```
